Viewsource
==========

Viewsource is a tool originally designed to help write dehydra-based plugins by
means of dumping out the arguments passed into functions. It is useful if you
are using one of the referenced tools, or if you are interested in seeing what
the code actually looks like by the time it gets to a compiler.

Requirements
============

You need a web server that is capable of running CGI scripts. You will need
python (to run the CGI scripts). And you will also need the tools used to run
these scripts:

Dehydra (See https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Dehydra)
JSHydra (See https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JSHydra)

Once those are installed, you should update viewsource.config as appropriate to
point to installation paths. After that, load up the page in your favorite web
browser and test it with a sample program to make sure it works.
